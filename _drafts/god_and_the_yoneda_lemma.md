When Jordan Peterson is asked "Do you believe in god" he gives a very long winded, but ultimately coherent answer. In particular, it is an answer that allows one to retain rational thinking without abandoning ones feelings. I'll try to distill his answer here.  There are things which we feel to be true.  For example, we feel that a life spent snorting cocaine, just below the threshold to kill you, and doing so for 75 years, is not a good life.  This is in spite of the levels of pleasure from this "optimal" usage of cocaine.  For some reason we feel this to be true, without any prior data to justify it. Therefore it's a belief.  I guess Dr Peterson sees a lot of things in the Bible which reflect this sort of common sense morality.
