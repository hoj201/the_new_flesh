Roro and I were playing with Lego batmans, and they were fighting Mr Freeze. They won. Then Roro's batman whispered to my batman "Hey Batman, guess what?"

"What?" I responded.
"There is a little boy controlling us named Roro."
"Wait, what?  He's controlling us?"
"Yeah." Roro whispered
"Is he nice?"
"Yeah.  Sometimes he gets us bad guys to fight, but sometimes he can't find them.  Can you help?"
"Okay Batman", I puppeted.

Anyway, sort of a surreal moment.
