I have a confession to make. It's hard for me to admit this, but since we've gotten to know each other, I think you have earned the right to know. Please don't tell anybody this.  You must promise. Okay here goes.

I've never dropped acid.

I know, it's very embarrassing, and hard to believe.  Please do not tell my mother and father.  They might disown me. I've managed to get by by faking it all these years with a synthetic substitute.  Ultra high doses of the Yoneda Lemma.

## Examples of the Yoneda Lemma
My first dose of the Yoneda Lemma occurred during my second post-doc under the guise of the reconstruction theorem.  This was a life changing event, perhaps not as important but as acute and pronounced as the birth of my son.

### The reconstruction theorem
 The reconstruction theorem states that you can reconstruct a $C^k$-manifold $$M$$ from just the Banach algebra of smooth real-valued functions $$C^{k}(M)$$.  This is the opposite direction of what we might intuit.  Intuitively, you have $$M$$ first, and then you define the algebra $$C^{k}(M)$$ second.  That you can go in reverse is the content of the reconstruction theorem.  In words, if you landed on a (compact) planet that may or may not be spherical and you were given just two sensors, $$x$$ and $$y$$, such that the readings from the sensors were independent, then you could manufacture other sensors such as $$x^2$$ and $$x+y$$ and $$xy$$, in fact, you could generate the ring $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.  Then you could place the sup-norm on this ring to get a Banach algebra, $$A$$. That Banach algebra is sufficient to derive a topological space $$M$$ such that we can view $$x$$ and $$y$$ as maps $$x,y: M \to \mathbb{R}$$.  Explicitly, this is done by looking at $$A^{\ast}$$ and then considering the set of elements $$\phi \in A^{\ast}$$ such that $$\phi(x_1,x_2) = \phi(x_1) \phi(x_2)$$ for all $$x_1,x_2 \in A$$.  The space of such $$\phi$$'s can be endowed with a topology, and in fact this space is precisely $$M$$.  Posteriori, we realize the the $$\phi$s are just the Dirac-delta functionals, which obviously exist in one-to-one correspondence with elements of $$M$$, but this statement only makes syntactic sense if there is an $$M$$ to discuss.

 You can feel that this is true if you consider the following scenario.  Let's say you land on a planet, and you have a collection of all possible sensors.  You start walking.  You notice your sensors are all outputting zeroes at one moment.  You start to walk at a constant speed, and the sensors evolve continuously in time, and then exactly $2 \pi$ seconds later you see that the sensors are all at zero again. There is only one manifold with this property, $$S^1$$, a circle.

### The Gelfand-Naimark Theorem
My second encounter with Yoneda occurred while writing my final (and still un-published) paper. Recall, a $$C^{\ast}$$-algebra, $$A$$ is a Banach algebra with an involution, $$\ast$$ (i.e. $$(x^{\ast})^{\ast} = x, \forall x \in A$$ ) such that
 - $$(\lambda x)^{\ast} = \bar{\lambda} x^{\ast}$$
 - $$(xy)^{\ast} = y^{\ast} x^{\ast}$$
 - $$\|x^{\ast} x \| = \| x \|^2$$
for all $$x,y \in A$$.

The Gelfand-Naimark theorem states that $$A$$ is always isomorphic to a sub-algebra of bounded operators on some Hilbert space. Again, this feels like going the opposite direction of what's intuitive.  The consequences for the ontological foundation of quantum mechanics can not be over-stated here.  The objects of quantum mechanics are the rays of a Hilbert space, and Gelfand-Naimark theorem states that you can start with the observables first, and derive *what it is you are observing from the observables*.  So fucked up!

Side-note: If $$A$$ is commutative, then we get the reconstruction theorem.
