I grew up sort of Jewish (sort of Jewish people know what I'm talking about).  None the less, Christmas was not foreign.  When I was in kindergarten I remember being told by a fellow class mate in mid December that an obese man who loved children watches us perpetually. Moreover, this mysterious man would be entering our homes while we sleep in a matter of days.  At age five this seemed plausible, and nothing to worry about because I was also told he was nice and handed out candy and gifts.

Christmas has always been a bizarre holiday, but one I've generally enjoyed from afar (perhaps because of its surreality). Now that I am raising a child, we actual do the whole Christmas thing: killing a tree and dragging it into our living room, hanging up the oversized socks, lying to our child, it's great!

My family is listening to the itunes Christmas pop-list on repeat, and so I felt the compelled to record my top five Christmas movie recommendations.  Just to make this clear, these are **not** my favorite Christmas movies.  They are just my favorite movies to recommend. The distinction manifests in the fact that "It's a Wonderful Life" is not on the list.  "It's a Wonderful Life" is a better Christmas movie than most of the movies on this list, but I get virtually no joy from recommending it because many people are going to watch it anyway during Christmas just by getting bored, and turning on TCM.

Without further ado, my top five Christmas recommendations, in descending order.

## \# 5: Batman Returns
It is always a cold dark night in Gotham city with snow drifting down majestically from a overcast sky. Repeated failed attempts to light Gotham's Christmas tree in their version of Rockeller Center provide the movie with one of its main through-lines.

The "villains" of Batman Returns are the penguin and cat women. The penguin is abandoned by his parents at night, dumped into the sewer and floated down the river in a basket like baby Moses, until he finds a new crew to take care of him. There are actually numerous biblical reference related to Pengiun in this movie, which I'm not really qualified to elaborate on, cuz I only grew up sort of Jewish and I've never read the bible. Anyway, the cradle hits a concrete barrier eventually, and he's adopted by actual penguins who themselves were abandoned by a defunct zoo.

The origin of Catwomen is also compelling, and provides us a cartoonish villian with at least one layer of depth (I really mean that as a complement). Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfiefer) is a mild-mannered secretary perpetually disrespected by her employer, played by Max Wren (Christopher Walken). Max Wren is the real villain of the film, a robber barren of public works building an fund for his son. He pushes Selina out a window, in hopes of killing her (after she foolishly threatens black mail).  Unbeknownst to him, she survives the fall. She has nine lives, and this first rebirth is the origin of Catwomen. The emergence of Catwomen from Selina's descent into madness is a cinematic depiction of the birth of the darker parts of the MeToo movement.  Crazed and angry, but can you blame her?

## \# 4: Brazil

A typical sci-fi about a retro-futuristic dystopia, but with Christmas and conga music, it can only be described as Gilliamesque. Depicted below is Sam Lowry's Christmas gift
![gift for an executive](link)

a gift fit for an executive in our bureaucratic fever dream. Like Gilliam himself, the film has a lot to say, and although much of it is style over substance, it is some style!

 - Industrial air ducts installed in the center of fine dining institutions
 - Monochromatic CRT monitors behind plastic magnifiers
 - Neon

A boy sits on Santa's Claus's lap.

Then Robert De Niro (a plumber) gets literally eaten by paperwork. Don't worry employee DZ-015, "We're all in it together"

## \# 3: Toys
Many people consider this to be a bad movie. I don't agree, but I'm very very sympathetic to the sentiment. It was made just after "Hook", during the peak of the Robin Williams 90s mania, and he is peak obnoxious in this Barry Levinson film.

Unlike my other recommendations though, this movie really sticks out because it's an actual bonafide Christmas movie. The movie begins and ends with a Christmas celebration, and the movie is an ode to a child-like approach to adulthood.  **Warning:** *do not take this movie seriously.  You will be punished.* The people who enjoy this movie are of the highly suggestible type, easily won by wacky and surreal.

The setting is a warped and cartoon like version of our own world. The aesthetic could best be described as what would happen if Rene Magritte were transported to the late 1980s and got his hands on early CGI. In this fantasy world of infinite green pastures we find a Willie Wonka-ish toy maker is on his death bed.  He hands over the controls of his toy factory to his brother, a decorated officer of the Military who never had the privilege of seeing action. The question naturally arises, why did this Willy Wonka toy guy not hand control over to his son who knew the business from top to bottom, and actually loves toys.  However, the reason is obvious.  His son is played by Robin Williams.  Nuff said.

The general is now faced with the challenge of running a business in an industry he could not care less about. However, he gets an insane idea that could only be envisioned by one with a warped and demented nature. He imagines a future where military enlistment declines, and wars are fought with toy airplanes, armed with real weapons. Large complexes of young men and women, playing video games from the safety of middle America, while bombs go off in distant lands that they will never see. Did I mention, that this movie was made in 1992?

## \# 2: Will you be my neighbor
If you thought toys was too saccharine, then prepare to be kneed in the groin with love and kindness. I consider this to be the most personally impactful movie I saw in 2018 (not that I sam many).

## \# 1: Louis Season 3, episode 30,31,36-39
Technically this is not a movie, but it's a two hour piece of entertainment which would be indistinguishable from a movie if it weren't in the form of a TV show[^louis].  I always thought of Louis C.K. as an odd-ball film maker who happened to do comedy.  Perhaps that is wrong, and he's said precisely the opposite.  However, I've always had a soft spot for him as a film maker, growing up and seeing him host an independent short film on Television.  He made it look easy, and legitimate to make a humorous low budget film with no coherent message, but clearly backed by something ethereally powerful.  In my opinion, these episodes of Louis are his best works (and I am including his comedy).  I'm hesitant to give to much details since the best parts are surprises, but I will give a quick Christmas related preview.  The first scene of episode 39 involves Louis staying up very very late preparing the Christmas gifts for his daughters, and he breaks down crying, and it's really funny.  This string of episodes deals with loneliness, ambition, and death in such an original way.  If you're somebody who obsesses over these things (loneliness, ambition, and death) than please watch these episodes. Sorry, it's hard to do this show justice in text, but it's certainly my favorite TV Christmas special, and when I have it compete alongside movies, it still comes out on top.


[^louis] Do not misconstrue enjoying an artists work with condoning his/her actions in the world. Discovering that he is kind of gross and probably did damage to people does not change the past. A more extreme case is Roman Polanski, a man who really should be both jailed and win an oscar. If Hitler directed Chinatown, than it would still be Chinatown, one of the greatest detective films of all time.
