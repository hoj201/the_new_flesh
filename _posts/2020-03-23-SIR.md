The SIR model is the most basic deterministic model of infectious disease dynamics. Navier-Stokes is to fluid models what SIR is to epidemiology.  I suspect a lot of technically minded individuals are pinging the wikipedia page, before turning around because they don't have time. The point of this post is to describe the SIR model in a couple paragraphs.  Let's go.

## Variables
The variables of the model are

 - $$s(t)$$: the portion of the population susceptible to infection at time $$t$$.
 - $$i(t)$$: the portion of the population currently infected
 - $$r(t)$$: the portion of the population recovered

Since each of these variables represents a portion of the population, each takes a value between $$0$$ and $$1$$. That the system is closed means

$$
	s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1
$$

We are ignoring the fact that people die in this model.

## Dynamics
New infections are created by interactions between infected people and susceptible people. In the case of random interactions, the number of interactions is proportional to the product "$$i \cdot s$$".  Infections are destroyed as people recover, at some rate $$\gamma > 0$$. If the rate of infection is $$\beta > 0$$ then $$di/dt = \beta i \cdot s - \gamma i$$. You can write down all this logic in the dynamical equations

$$
\begin{align*}
	\frac{ds}{dt} &= - \beta i \cdot s \\
	\frac{di}{dt} &= \beta i \cdot s - \gamma i \\
	\frac{dr}{dt} &= \gamma i
\end{align*}
$$



To study the dynamics, we can rescale time by the infection rate $$\tau := \gamma t$$ and thus study the ODE

$$
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{ds}{d\tau} &= - R_0 i s \\
		\frac{di}{d\tau} &= R_0 i s - i \\
		\frac{dr}{dt} &= -i
	\end{align*}
$$

where $$R_0 = \beta / \gamma$$.  This is the "R-naught" that is being spoken of in [any of those articles you might read that talk about "flattening the curve"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html). It's also called the "basic reproduction number".  If $$R_0 > 1$$ we get an epidemic, if it's less than $$1$$ we get exponential decay. In the case of covid-19, $$R_0 \approx 2.5$$ without any intervention. In the (unrealistic) case where everybody without exception practices social distancing $$R_0 = 0$$.

## What could happen?
What could happen, qualitatively is illustrated in this plot

We have $$R_0 = 2.5$$, and the plot suggests that at some point, 20 percent of people would be infected. Which is crazy.  About 20% of that 20% (so 4%) will need hospitalization, and about a quarter of those in need of hospitalization will need ventilators (so 1%), which makes me feel a little sick to write. I'm not an epidemiologist, but my guess is that many of the projections that are being made by the experts are reasoning in a way that resembles what's written here.
