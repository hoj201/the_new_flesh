title: My problem with ejucation
---

I'm not a fan of my son's kindergarten. Let me explain why.

The machinations of the enlightment: 

 - demography
 - chemistry
 - calculus
 - the copernican model
 - double column book keeping
 - stocks and commodities markets
 - credit

had given rise to actual machines: the combustion engine, the cotton gin, precision chronometers, thermometers, and barometers, takometers.  The rise of the worlds first true democractic republic, the United States of America, engendered a new demand for an accurate census, to account for the voting power of each state in the union. We counted people, we counted slaves as non-people but convertable at a ratio of 0.6 people per slave, and we counted output. We counted assets, and we estimated value.  The value of a slave after the invention of the cotton gin might be estimated by the quality of his hands.  Determining how well could his fingers could perform the micro-motions required to pick cotton for 18 hours a day was literally proportional to his value. Most of what we count is a noisy estimate of an elusive and ethereal quantity; value. And so it has been since our nations founding. After denouncing slavery, our original sin, we continue to live in a world that promoted it.  An uncompromising world born in the mind of Francis Bacon. Today we measure the micromotions of 5 year olds, to assess their ability to write letters. Something that they will be doing much of in the years to come so as to forecast the childs future value to the machine. **In summary, our society is a machine that eats souls of children and produces adult-size machines in its own likeness. Through parenting for six years now, this is the conclusion that I have come to.** There is a another machine that does this. I'd call this machine the "state of nature"

## The state as a state of nature

Thomas Hobbes will forever be linked to his description of a state of nature in Leviathan: "nasty, brutish and short" was inspired by the struggles he saw in abandoned colonies such as Roanoke, where he observed starvation, factionalism, cannabalism, and death. It's not hard to theorize that the events in this sequence formed a chain of causation. Starvation first leading to factionalism, somebody dies during a battle. Hmm, a dead body? Cut to image of a severed leg roasting over an open fire. While we obviously have a government, and mass starvation is not the top issue of the moment, there is a starvation of a different form among our kids, and a factionalism of a different form, and a cannabalism of a different form. With periodic testing (an literal starvation, but I'll get to that), our 5 year old son felt starved of security. With a society that does not reward joy or play, families and children are factionalized and pitted against each other in a never ending competition to avoid ostracism.  Finally, the threat of ostracism is carried out. Children who "fall through the cracks" are devoured by a never ending cycle of bullying and failure. That said, it's the only game in town. If I'm honest, I will likely be putting my son back into the machine this fall.[^harris]

[^harris]: The point made in this paragraph is argues more thoroughly by Malcolm Harris in his manifesto "Kids These Days".

We know this system is immoral. The psychologists hate it. The teachers hate it. The principals hate it. The parents hate it. My kid certainly hates it. Who is this system serving? Whos gross nightmare is this?

## Strange organisms
When I went to school, kindergarten was for play. Yes we learned a bit of handwriting, maybe even some cursive.  However, lunch was a full 45 minutes and there was a ten minute recess. In between, many of the activities were playful things like macaroni art. Things are different now. Lunch is 20 minutes, with about 15 minutes used for getting to/from the lunch tables on short and stubby kindergartener feet. My child is a slow eater, so this meant he would typically eat nothing between the hours of 8am and 5pm when we picked him up. This also means that there is no play time.  His classroom had no toys. At least nothing fun. He claimed his main activity was going to the "math center", which was really just a table with shredded paper, which he could count. The first time I heard this I laughed because its so pathetic... then I was sad.

 There is no mandate for this idiocy. As far as I can tell, it's self imposed by many of the schools in my area. From talking to other parents, it sounds as if the schools here are very competitive against each other. It's not just the students, but the schools themselves are in a battle against one another for public resources, awarded based upon student performance.  If cutting lunch by 25 minutes boosts test scores, you better do it because the school next door is looking at the same data and probably thinking the same thing. If that produces a few dropouts while bumping the average score, then all the better. If you want to make an omelette, you've got to ruin a few childhoods.
 
It's the same pattern again. This race to the top is really a race to the bottom where starvation and factionalism transform all participants into metric obsessed zombies. The leap from child-to-school is the leap from the sub-atomic to atomic.  Let's go one level higher. Who is driving the schools to push literacy earlier, and replace macaroni art with STEM initiatives? It's largely policy driven by think-tanks and academics who observe that our economy has a high demand for STEM, and what is our economy but a group of firms competing for resources. Firms that fight one another to survive, and then cannabalize one another thorugh mergers and aquisitions.

So we have an answer to the question, "who benefits? Whos nightmare is this?".  It's not collegeboard.com. It's not some evil cabal of capitalists. The primary benficiary is the repeated structure of hunger and factionalism itself.  I don't know what to call it, but it's a strange organism that produces copies of itself at different scales. In this limit, the structure exists at all scales.  There's a name for this. Mathematicians call it "self-similarity".

## A self-similar nightmare
I'm pretty sure the term "self-similarity" is attributable to Benoit Mandlebrot, famous for exposing countless pot-smoking highschool dropouts to higher mathematics through posters such as this one

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mandel_zoom_08_satellite_antenna.jpg#/media/File:Mandel_zoom_08_satellite_antenna.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Mandel_zoom_08_satellite_antenna.jpg/1200px-Mandel_zoom_08_satellite_antenna.jpg" alt="Mandel zoom 08 satellite antenna.jpg"></a><br>By Created by <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Wolfgangbeyer" title="User:Wolfgangbeyer">Wolfgang Beyer</a> with the program Ultra Fractal 3. - <span class="int-own-work" lang="en">Own work</span>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" title="Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=322029">Link</a></p>

These structures are made by taking a formula (in this case $$z^2 + c$$) and applying it over and over again, forever. In nutshell, this is where self-similarity comes from.  You apply a thing everywhere in sight. In the case of economy-schools-students, that formula is the market solution.

In theory the market should be serving its constituents.  However, the reverse is occuring.

How is it that the masters have become the slaves of the market. The computational scientist in me is attracted to market solutions, because they are basically a human-powered Monte-Carlo algorithms. Briefly, a Monte-Carlo algorithm is an optimization algorithm that can roughly be summarized as "do a bunch of random things, something will work out". It's a method that was developed by Stanislaw Ulam and implemented on the ENIAC in the 1940s by Jon Von Neumann for computing numerical solutions to problems in thermodynamics. It's a very flexible method that often works, and so it was applied everywhere in sight. Intuitively, that's the beginning and end of the story. Market solutions are a similar sort of algorithm, also easy to apply, and so they are applied frequently.

The issue might not be market solutions in and of themselves, so much as it's our unoriginal repeated application of it. If we view market solutions as optimization algorithms (which is a view I hold), then they are great as long as the thing they are optimizing is something that makes us happier.  In otherwords, the performance metric should be something we actually want more of such as "happiness". However, the entity which kicks off the chain, working backwards from miserable kindergartners to overworked teachers to policy wonks to corporate board rooms to is consumer demand. Indirectly, we are take it on faith that what we demand as consumers makes us happy as people.

I've lost my faith. It's 2020, the market is great. CPI is high, inflation is low. It's been the longest economic expansion in US history. Yet something tells me, we are not a happy nation. Many believe we are in an epidemic of [deaths from despair](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/28/deaths-of-despair-us-jobs-drugs-alcohol-suicide). Consumer and market behavior are decoupling from emotional health. This decoupling should surprise nobody. There are many things that I wish I could pay for:

 - A community
 - A sense of purpose
 - A stable climate

However, these are not available for purchase on Amazon. The list of things you can't get on Amazon illustrates the discrepency between consumer demand and the desires of citizens.

## The purpose of education
In some sense, this is an exceedingly unoriginal thesis. Just another rant to complain how capitalism has permeated every aspect of life. However, I've not seen the thesis framed in quite this way. If the principal of your child's school told you that a monte-carlo algorithm run on a supercomputer had determined it's best that your children did not get to eat food at lunch. I doubt you would roll your eyes and shrug it off.

So, what's to be done? This is what education is for.  Education is supposed to mold children into successful adults. The arguement then hinges on the term "successful". Whomever, or whatever, defines that term would be a driver of education decisions. Currently, success is defined by market demand, alibeit indirectly. This has the virtue that by linking success of the individual with the market, we can sate our demands as consumers.  However, I am not hungry as a consumer.  My cabinet is stocked, and I don't need more gizmos. Sating the market only meets the first rung of Maslow's heirarchy. I am hungry as a human.[^th]

## Childhood's end
This post started by recalling how the enlightenment got us here. Now I fear we are about to enter a second dark age where adults are capitalist zombies and the children aren't really children. This decade might be our last shot to question things. It's hard for people to connect the dots given the torrent of information that is available. In fact it's probably easier to connect the dots without all the dots.  I strongly recommend people do not read the news. Do not use YouTube.  Do not use Facebook.  Just close your laptop now and enjoy a good book or see a movie at the theatre. Hear the news from others, or by chance on the radio at the Halal restarant. Then give yourself some time to think. If there is any virtuous legacy of the enlightenment era, it's the value of thought over dogma. 

Now ponder this. Is childhood valuable? It's loss could be a canary in the coal mine. What sort of adults come of children without a childhood?

... this needs to end more hopeful. Perhaps end with a reference to the enlightenment.

## What's wrong with market solutions
In theory, there is nothing wrong with market solutions if the goal is to do a bunch of expirements and then reward the winner.  However, the terms "reward" and "winner" should be made precise. By winner, we mean that there is some performance metric we'd like to optimize.  By "reward", we mean that there is some mechanism that kills off all low performers, so the reward is the survival of the best ideas.  I have no problem with this.

Even in the case of schooling, I'd have no problem with this. In the case of schooling let's for the moment assume our goal is optimizing a test score (I have my qualms, but we'll table that argument). In that case we'd have numerous schools execute various ideas, log them down, then we'd have the students take the test. One of these schools will perform the best.  At that point



## Wait... what?
Okay, not literal zombies. By zombie I'm referring to a certain mindset. One that can be summarized with the following infinite-loop

 - Yawn (waking up)... I'm hungry.
 - What lever do I need to pull to get the (cocaine-laced) pellet?
 - Oh right, it's the

## Prohibition
There are many industries that are simply outlawed. The easiest example is paying for people to kill people. Firstly, it's already against the law to kill people.  It's also illegal to pay people to kill other people. Why is this? This question, at least to me, is harder to answer than it may first appear. Apriori there is a slim chance that the world would be a better place with a killing industry.  Perhaps there truly are villains who deserve death, and the invisible hand of the market is well equipped to find them.  I doubt it though, and the simplest gut-check tells one that this industry is a bad idea. By the same (non)-logic, manufacturing poverty should also be outlawed. Becoming policy-wonk is not necccessary to come to this conclusion.

In Finland, children are put in actual nature, which is substantially more nurturing.

 This might have the virtue that the society also produces souls. Undoubtedly, the population explosion that happened after the industrial revolution is largely creditable to technology (certainly more than other virtuous things such as human rights).  However, even that would be too rosy a picture in my mind. Many millions of years ago, the cambrian age began, and there was an explosion in biodiversity. Millions of years later the cambrian age ended, and the carcases of dead trilobytes and prehistoric fish decomposed into the basic hydrocarbons of petroleum. Our current age is a fraction of a percent of the Cambrian era in length, yet we are slated to burn a good chunk of the biomass created during that time.  In fact, the ostensible goal is to burn it all. This would destroy all the souls, and the entirety of human history will be merely a "pfft". So why are we doing this?

In the middle - talk about the rise of optimization

This is something close to what Malcolm Harris is articulating in "Kids these days".  However, that book gets very specific. 

The answer is that it's serving us individually, but not collectively. We are all participating in a tragedy of the common, a massive multiplayer prisoners dillemma. By placing our kids in a race to the top, we are inadvertently executing a painful race to the bottom.  


What does the human body need to thrive? The bottom layer of Maslow's heirarchy of needs lists:
 - air
 - water
 - food
 - shelter
 - sleep
 - clothing
 - reproduction

 We could descend into bitterness, and complain that our air is dirty and our water is tainted with lead.  However, our air is getting better, and our water has seen worse days as well.  Things could be (and have been) worse. However, we have the resources to put everybody on this first rung of the heirarchy at no cost. Healthy people in the US have a diet of roughly 3000 Calories per day.  The number of man hours required to produce a healthy diet is
